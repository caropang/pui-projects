## Extra Work
* Added working product pages for each item with changing names, images, descriptions, andy all cart functionality.
* Product pages and menu items are generated dynamically from an array of JS objects, making it easy to add and remove items from menu, create new product pages with consistent styling, and make changes to the product page layouts. This functionality would be very useful for a real bakery, since it would allow them to easily update their flavor offerings. By adding a new JS object to the product array with two lines of code specifying a new product name, path to image, and description, a new product will be rendered on the menu page with a working link to a new product page with the same functionality as all the other product pages.
* Added wishlist functionality. Users can add and remove items from their wishlist on the menu and product details page. Items in wishlist are displayed below the basket. Users can click on items in the wishlist which leads them to the corresponding product page where users can add the item to their basket.
* Added carousel of related products on product detail page. Arrows can be clicked to rotate images. Each slide contains a link to the corresponding product page. Inspired by example from: https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_slideshow.asp
